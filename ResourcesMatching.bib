  abstract = {The construction industry in the United States and other parts of the world has been facing several challenges, including a shortage of skilled workers. A review of the relevant body of knowledge indicates that one of the key reasons for this problem is the absence of human resource management strategies for construction workers at project, corporate, regional, or industry levels. This paper addresses the issues of workforce training and allocation on construction projects. It presents a framework to optimize the investment in, and to make the best use of, the available workforce with the intent to reduce project costs and improve schedule performance. A linear program model, entitled the Optimal Workforce Investment Model, is built to provide an optimization-based framework for matching supply and demand of construction labor most efficiently through training, recruitment, and allocation. Given a project schedule or demand profile and the available pool of workers, the suggested model provides human resource managers a combined strategy for training the available workers and hiring additional workers. The input data to the proposed model consists of a certain available labor pool, cost figures for training workers in different skills, the cost of hiring workers, hourly labor wages, and estimates of affinities between the different considered skills. The objective of the model is to minimize labor costs while satisfying project labor demands. Results from application of the model to typical situations are presented, and recommendations for future developments are made.},

  title = {{水电工程施工多任务多设备的二部匹配优化研究}},
  abstract = {随着工程设计与施工技术的进步,水电工程施工逐渐演变为极为复杂的生产活动,其工程量巨大,经常需要进行多施工任务作业。当有多种施工设备投入施工时,合理的多任务多设备匹配方案将极大地优化施工作业面以及施工作业设备,能够让更多的设备和作业面参与到施工过程中,减少设备闲置和作业面窝工。若考虑不同设备在不同施工任务中所产生的综合效益不同,则合理的匹配方案更能在兼顾优化作业面及作业设备的同时,又能保证施工综合效益最优。
首先,根据工程机械定义及类组划分原则,分析设备资源调配特点,基于资源调配三要素将设备资源调配分为设备资源调度和设备资源配置两类。考虑水电工程多施工任务特点,对多任务多设备配置行为的内容进行分析,并对设备配置的后效性与设备群进行合理假设,以便增加约束条件,简化二部图模型建立过程。
其次,以最小化闲置设备数和窝工作业面数为目标,对多任务多设备的配置问题进行研究。基于多任务多设备的配置问题进行合理化假设,寻求施工任务与设备的配置关系,构建二部图无权匹配模型。利用二部图的无权匹配匈牙利算法求解配置结果,最后通过案例计算验证模型及算法的合理性和有效性。
然后,在获得最小窝工的前提下,为了进一步寻找质量更优、进度更快、成本更低的配置方案,在对多任务多设备的配置问题进行研究的过程中,考虑施工设备投入到各施工任务的相对权重大小,重新定义配置关系,建立多任务多设备的赋权匹配模型。建立设备配置方案的评价指标体系,利用标准化方法对各实测分项指标权重值进行标准化处理,利用AHP方法,依据指标体系对标准化处理后的分项指标权重值进行综合,将处理后的数据作为施工设备投入到各施工任务的相对权重,对新的配置关系进行分析,构建二部图的赋权匹配模型,利用二部图的赋权匹配KM算法求解配置结果,最后经案例验证和结果分析,证实算法的合理性和实用性。
综上,合理构建二部图匹配模型可以有效解决多任务多设备的配置优化程度差的问题,这些方法计算简便、结果合理,运用该模型求解可以有效减少水电工程中设备闲置和作业面窝工现象,同时对施工的多任务多设备配置系统优化具有重要的指导意义,为工程施工中的设备指派问题提供了一个新的解决办法。},

This information is usually stored in SQL-based data warehouses to facilitate planning, maintenance or shutdown business processes. The proposed semi-structured database system stores information in JSON format, thus requiring a different approach in structuring, querying and aggregating data. The prototype storage model implemented in MongoDB looks very promising. JSON structure is a convenient way for storing project data, test scenarios show it being faster than a SQL alternative, and flexible schema definition means it is properly aligned with the agile development strategy. This storage approach fulfils the requirements of the project and is expected to be expanded to support ontology-driven storage, knowledge sharing and 3D model integration for a web application.},

The study reported by this paper is motivated by recent assertions about the genesis and evolution of knowledge management capability (KMC) in the strategic management field. It attempts to shed light on the governance of learning mechanisms that develop KMC within the context of construction firms. A questionnaire survey was administered to a sample of construction contractors operating in the very dynamic Hong Kong market to elicit opinions on the learning mechanisms and business outcomes of targeted firms. On the basis of a total of 149 usable responses, structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis identified relationships among knowledge-governance mechanisms, knowledge processes, and business performance, thereby supporting the existence of strategic learning loops. The study findings provide evidence from the construction context for capability assertions that knowledge-governance mechanisms and processes form learning mechanisms that carry out strategic learning to create value, effect performance outcomes, and ultimately drive the evolution of KMC. The findings imply that it is feasible for managing construction firms to govern learning mechanisms through managing the capability-based holistic KM system, thereby reconfiguring KMC to match needs in the dynamic market environment over time.},

Technological advancements and continuous fragmentation in the construction industry have resulted in a rapid increase in the complexity of projects, and yet this has not been matched by a concomitant increase in planning efforts. This study aims to identify the importance of FEP and its impact on project outcomes in order to encourage more organizations in Singapore to practice and benefit from it. To achieve this objective, a questionnaire was developed, and the responses from 27 companies were analyzed. The analysis revealed that only about 44\% of the responding companies practiced FEP on their projects. In addition, the study quantified the amount of the budget allocated to FEP as well as the level of improvement in project performance achieved by implementing FEP. Once companies recognize their FEP implementation status, they will be at a starting point to understand its importance and impact and will be able to better manage their projects, ultimately allowing the Singapore construction industry to increase its opportunity for producing more successful projects overall.},

  abstract = {:  The need to match project managers’ (PMs) performance measures onto projects of both unique and similar characteristics has long since been acknowledged by researchers. The need for these measures to reflect the various phases of the project life cycle has also been contended in the recent past. Here, a competency-based multidimensional conceptual model is proposed for mass house building projects (MHBPs). The model reflects both performance behaviors and outcome in predicting the PMs’ performances at the conceptual, planning, design, tender, construction, and operational phases of the project life cycle. Adopting a positivist approach, data elicited for the construction phase is analyzed using multiple regression techniques (stepwise selection). Out of a broad range of behavioral metrics identified as the independent variables, the findings suggest the best predictors of PMs’ performances in MHBPs at the construction phase are: job knowledge in site layout techniques for repetitive construction works; dedication in helping works contractors achieve works schedule; job knowledge of appropriate technology transfer for repetitive construction works; effective time management practices on house units; ability to provide effective solution to conflicts, simultaneously maintaining good relationships; ease with which works contractors are able to approach the PM and volunteering to help works contractors solve personal problems. ANOVA, multicollineriality, Durbin–Watson, and residual analysis, confirm the goodness of fit. Validation of the model also reflected reasonably high predictive accuracy suggesting the findings could be generalized. These results indicate that the model can be a reliable tool for predicting the performance of PMs in MHBPs.},

Overall, 55 projects were evaluated. Success, however, is a subjective concept that often depends on the team member providing the definition. Consequently, during the interview process, project managers were asked to provide their own definition of successful performance, and this definition was matched to the collected data to identify appropriate variables for inclusion in a performance measurement index. A reliability analysis was performed, and six variables were ultimately used to construct the index, including actual percent profit, percent schedule overrun, amount of time given, communication between team members, budget achievement, and change in work hours. A cross-validation technique was used to evaluate the performance measurement index, and a misclassification rate of 2\% was observed, which indicated that the model was useful for quantitatively measuring successful performance based on the project managers’ definitions of success.},

RCM is an operational decision-making tool based on lean principles that supports short-term forecasting commitment planning using common-site information such as workers, buffers, and plans.

By modeling the site operation of sieving and stockpiling broken concrete, the well-established construction simulation methodology of CYCLONE was contrasted with the newly developed simplified discrete event simulation approach (SDESA). Further, the SDESA model was readily extended to include (1) raw demolition waste collecting and sorting; (2) broken concrete sieving and stockpiling; (3) steel bar recycling; and (4) debris disposal at the landfill. The production rate derived from simulation was indicative of a close match between the simulation model and the actual site system. The resulting simulation model provided a basis for evaluating the cost efficiency of actual site operations and alternative resource provision scenarios being postulated. Through computer simulation, the actual site operation was found smooth and efficient with utilization rates for resources of different types ranging from 79 to 99\%. In addition, the cost–time reduction ratios were calculated for four alternatives of resource provisions in comparison with the original base case. The research findings suggested that provided the project budget had satisfied the higher cash flow requirement, doubling the resource provision on site would potentially cut the project duration by half and not increase the total direct cost.},

This method works for projects with clearly assigned tasks, specific requirements, finely tuned organizations, and explicit roles and responsibilities for the project team. However, for projects that exist in a fast-paced and complex environment and are performed by temporary organizations, this task-centric method neglects the interdependence between project tasks and project contextual factors, such as project organizations, teams, knowledge, and resources that have considerable effect on task completion and project effectiveness. To investigate the congruence, the matching degree, between task assignment and the project’s organizational environment, this study uses a three-dimensional metanetwork analysis (MNA) to model a project’s personnel [hereinafter referred to as agents (A)], knowledge (K), tasks (T), and all six interconnected networks: AA, AK, AT, KK, KT, and TT networks. MNA can identify incapable agents and overloaded tasks, which hinder the completion of tasks, and then it can optimize task assignment to achieve better project performance. Cross-case comparative studies of 11 Chinese automobile dealership construction projects were conducted in order to validate the proposed MNA model and optimization strategies. During the project optimization, three key network-level measures—the congruence of agent knowledge needs (COAKCOAK$<$math display="inline" overflow="scroll"$>$$<$mrow$>$$<$msub$>$$<$mi mathvariant="normal"$>$C$<$/mi$>$$<$mtext$>$OAK$<$/mtext$>$$<$/msub$>$$<$/mrow$>$$<$/math$>$), the congruence of task knowledge needs (COTKCOTK$<$math display="inline" overflow="scroll"$>$$<$mrow$>$$<$msub$>$$<$mi mathvariant="normal"$>$C$<$/mi$>$$<$mtext$>$OTK$<$/mtext$>$$<$/msub$>$$<$/mrow$>$$<$/math$>$), and task completion based on knowledge (TCKTCK$<$math display="inline" overflow="scroll"$>$$<$mrow$>$$<$msub$>$$<$mrow$>$$<$mi$>$TC$<$/mi$>$$<$/mrow$>$$<$mrow$>$$<$mi mathvariant="normal"$>$K$<$/mi$>$$<$/mrow$>$$<$/msub$>$$<$/mrow$>$$<$/math$>$)—increased by 22.1, 24.6, and 47.3\%, respectively.

The reason for this approach is that in practice the application of RSM may be hindered by several considerations, for example, repetitive units may be slightly different from each other, the performance of construction crews may vary, and there may be complex resource matching and sharing between activities and work sites. The proposed methodology is termed fuzzy repetitive scheduling method (F-RSM), and it requires a generalization of RSM in which schedules are represented by two- or three-dimensional graphs and whereby the concepts of a control segment and the controlling sequence area are introduced.

High task demands increase the likelihood of errors, with implications for rework, safety, and productivity.

This exploratory study investigated the task demands in masonry work, the factors that generate the demands, the influence of demands on performance, and the practices that field supervisors use to manage/regulate them. Data were collected on two masonry projects. The NASA Task Load Index (TLX) was used to measure the workers’ subjective assessment of task demands. The members of masonry crews perceived different type and level of task demands depending on their role—supervisor, masons, laborers, and operator. Interviews with the crew members identified design features and work practices that influenced the task demands. Extensive field observations identified three strategies that field supervisors use to manage task demands: (1)~matching task demands with capabilities; (2)~reducing temporal demands; and (3)~shifting task demands between roles. Finally, data were collected on performance problems with emphasis on delays, mistakes, rework, and safety incidents. Rework often involved higher task demands and hazards than the normal tasks. The study contributes to practice by identifying factors that increase the task demands of masonry activities and that need to be managed to improve performance. In terms of research, the study identifies and measures the multiple task demands for the different masonry crew roles, identifies sources of task demands, and strategies to manage them.},

A dual focus on the distributions of the possible errors in the time and cost estimates and on the reliability of the estimates used as planned values suggests an approach for developing reliable schedules and budgets with buffers for time and cost. This method for budgeting and scheduling is executed through either simulation or a simple analytical approximation. The dynamic buffers provide much-needed flexibility, accounting for the errors in cost and duration estimates associated with planning any real project, thus providing a realistic, practical, and dynamic approach to planning and scheduling.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a framework for autonomous data-driven discrete-event simulation (DES) modeling process that transforms operation data to Activity Cycle Diagram (ACD)-based DES models without a priori model network. The proposed framework uses the idea of process mining to discover a real process by extracting knowledge from activity logs, which are the lists of sequences of activities per cycle in terms of resources. The discovered process is then modeled as an ACD which can replicate the underlying activity logs. Activity log plays a key role in this procedure as it determines the set of activities that we can identify and thus govern the analysis scope of the generated simulation model. It is therefore important to design and collect activity log data in a way to capture all the activities for an intended abstraction level. In order to automate the model generation procedure considering this requirement, we employ the notion of activity ontology, which specifies various activities and their relations for a given construction operation at different abstraction levels in a predefined manner. Using the ontology-based framework, we can systemize the procedure of simulation modeling, which entails selecting the abstraction level of simulation model, identifying the list of activities that need to be inferred from data to create activity logs, and determining the type and resolution of data to be collected. The proposed framework is explained and demonstrated using an earthmoving operation example.},

We propose the use of a mathematical model to formulate and solve for the identified problem factoring in resource-time tradeoff options on individual activities. Then a crew-job interaction table is instrumental in visualizing the optimum resource-loaded schedule, which features the shortest project duration and the leanest resource supply under time-dependent resource constraints. Case studies are given to illustrate application of the proposed methodology. This technique potentially provides analytical decision support for not only making cost-effective resource-loaded schedules, but also facilitating the controllability of schedule execution.},

The existing methods for cost analysis of infrastructure networks are based on optimizing network costs for a limited period, and hence, are prone to: (i) shifting the cost burdens, (ii) not considering the service life of assets in a network beyond the planning horizon and (iii) not considering uncertainty in factors such as future preservation funding as well as timing and cost of preservation activities. In this paper, we propose a simulation framework to address these limitations in network-level cost analysis. The proposed framework is based on the premise that a sustainable practice is the one that provides the longest service life at the lowest cost in infrastructure networks. The proposed framework determines the network-level costs considering the dynamic network-agency-user interactions and uncertainties. The application of the proposed framework is demonstrated using a case study pertaining to a pavement network. The results show the capability of the proposed framework in evaluating and identifying sustainable strategies leading to the longest service life for the assets at the minimum network-level costs.},

  abstract = {Challenges encountered by facility managers include developing visual models in their mind to corroborate the relationship between two dimensional (2D) as-built drawings with the real world three dimensional (3D) elements, searching and validating information. These challenges can be addressed by using Building Information Model (BIM) in the O\&M phase. Accessing the information using BIM is a two-step process. The first step includes the identification and selection of the appropriate 3D element from the digital model and second step includes the retrieval of the information. Currently, the first step is accomplished by navigating the model manually. This step becomes tedious depending upon the size and complexity of the model. This identification selection process can be automated by integrating Quick Response (QR) code technology with BIM. This paper discusses the feasibility of developing an integrated BIM and QR code environment. It also discusses the pilot study conducted to deploy this environment.},

  abstract = {The AEC/FM industry has benefited from the innovative integration of information technologies and industry-wide processes in different lifecycle stages of facilities. Building Information Modeling (BIM), as one of these innovations, is fast becoming a key approach to virtually integrate the required information for facility design, construction, and management. So far, applications and benefits of using BIM tools and processes in building design and construction have been documented in research. However, landscape design and construction practice is underrated in current BIM developments and in integrated design-construction practices, and it has not benefited from the advantages BIM provides to the industry at different scales. This could result in a critical challenge, as BIM implementation and information modeling are becoming mandatory in many projects in public and private sectors, and the gap still exists in the processes of collaboration and information exchange between the landscape design and construction practice and other disciplines. As an early step to mitigate this challenge, this study shows that recent advances in BIM, COBie, information-exchange schemas (e.g. IFC), and taxonomies such as OmniClass have shortcomings in addressing landscape and hardscape elements and attributes. This challenge limits asset-management capabilities, and leads the practice to inefficient operations, more manual processes, and costly knowledge development and exchange. These findings have important implications for revising and updating existing taxonomies to support more automated information development and exchange processes.},

  abstract = {An essential part of construction project planning and control is the development of a model of the project’s construction processes. Discrete-event simulation is the most versatile of all modeling methods, but it lacks the simplicity in use of other modeling techniques and so has not been widely adopted in construction. The Critical Path Method (CPM) is the most popular project modeling method in construction since it is simple to use. However, it is limited to time-dependent constraints and does not handle work repetition very efficiently. Many other modeling techniques have been developed over the years but have a limited scope of application, being aimed at specialized types of project. Linear scheduling is one such example, being limited to work that progresses along a line, but is otherwise very easy to use and provides powerful visual insight into the interactions between crews and the performance of a project. Foresight is a new graphical constraint-based method of modeling construction processes, designed to offer the simplicity in use of CPM, the visual insight of linear scheduling, and the versatility of simulation. This paper compares Foresight with discrete-event construction simulation in terms of the simplicity of the resultant models for manufactured and on-site based produced components. A qualitative comparison of the two approaches is also included highlighting the superior visual insight provided by Foresight, a feature that facilitates verifying a model and determining an optimal project plan.},

  abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) has recently experienced rapid technological advancement and gained prevalence in the architectural, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. BIM models contain valuable information on buildings to support four-dimensional (4D) modeling that involves the integration of three-dimensional (3D) building components and time as specified in the one-dimensional (1D) construction schedule. While 4D modeling has been proven to be useful in effective construction management, a critical challenge in current 4D modeling practice is the discrepancy between the element breakdown structure (EBS) of the BIM model and the work breakdown structure (WBS) of scheduling. This discrepancy leads to considerable time and effort being spent on matching and linking BIM model components and schedule activities. This paper presents a framework for automating the generation of construction schedules during the BIM model creation process. A matching and pairing mechanism between EBS and WBS was created to automate the matching and linking between BIM model elements and construction schedule activities. A prototype system was developed and tested to validate this framework. The proposed framework is expected to automatically generate detailed construction schedules during the development process of BIM models.},

However, tower cranes and construction workers themselves suffer a significant safety hazards from natural sway of payloads. Besides, the external disturbance of wind leads to additional sway and intensifies the oscillation amplitude of crane load on construction site. Therefore, we propose a hybrid control mechanism that combine electronic and mechanical gyroscopes to produce a balancing torque, keeping crane load stable. We assume the crane load as in the case of the inverted pendulum and simulate the oscillation movement under continuous wind. A hybrid control mechanism is designed and developed, with the electronic gyroscope to track the real-time position and orientation of payload, with the mechanical gyroscope as an actuator of collected feedback to control the oscillation amplitudes. A wind tunnel test has been conducted to validate the developed hybrid mechanism.},

  title = {Crane {{Load Positioning}} And {{Sway Monitoring Using}} An {{Inertial Measurement Unit}}},
  abstract = {Crane operation is one of the most essential activities on construction sites. However, operating a crane is a sophisticated job which requires the operator to have extensive skills and experience, and most importantly a comprehensive understanding of crane motions. Besides typical crane motions such as boom slew, hoist, and extension, monitoring and controlling the position of the load is extremely important to avoid struck-by accidents caused by crane load, especially when the load swings as a result of wind and inertia. Although typical motions can be captured by some existing techniques, a reliable approach to position the load and monitor the load sway remains missing. This study proposes an orientation-based approach for tracking crane load position and monitoring load sway in daily lifting activities. This approach adopts an off-the-shelf inertial measurement unit (IMU) module for measuring load orientation, and an efficient algorithm for converting orientation measurements to load positions. The proposed approach was tested in two load sway scenarios in a controlled lab environment. Test results indicate that the proposed approach correctly converted orientation measurements to accurate load positions and reconstructed the load sway trajectory in both linear and circular sway motions. Enabling continuously monitoring of crane load motion, this approach augments the crane motion information obtained by typical crane motion capturing systems. The findings in the research will advance the safety practices in crane lifting activities.},

  abstract = {Since the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 was established, which places the responsibility of construction safety on the employer, various injury prevention strategies have been developed and resulted in a significant improvement of safety management in the construction industry. However, during the last decade, construction safety improvement has decelerated and, due to the dynamic nature of construction jobsites, most safety management activities have focused on safety monitoring during the construction phase. Traditional safety planning approaches rely mostly on static information, tacit knowledge, regulations, company safety policies, and 2D drawings. As a result, site-specific dynamic information, temporal (e.g. when and who will be exposed to potential hazards) and spatial (e.g. location of dangerous zones) information are currently not specifically addressed. This paper presents a formalized 4-dimensional (4D) construction safety planning process that addresses site-specific temporal and spatial safety information. The safety data, which includes general safety knowledge, site-specific temporal and spatial information, will be integrated from a project schedule and a 3D model, respectively. The proposed safety planning approach is expected to provide safety personnel with a site-specific proactive safety planning tool that can be used to better manage jobsite safety. In addition, visual safety materials can also aid in training workers on safety and, consequently, being able to identify site-specific hazards and respond to them more effectively.},

Practitioners often apply zoning to divide a building into a number of vertical zones to which lifts are assigned.

Service floors of zones are often overlapped on one or more floors for convenient transit between zones.

For this, a simple, yet practical mathematical model is proposed to estimate lifting time. An application example shows its potential for preparing an economical lifting plan.},

  abstract = {Critical Infrastructure (CI) plays a vital role in sustaining fundamental functionalities and services in urban systems. As these CI systems are getting more interdependent, disturbances in one CI system often propagate to other systems, imposing significant cascading and devastating risks on cities. This paper introduces a conceptual framework for modeling interdependencies between CI systems and analyzing the impacts of interdependencies on urban resilience. This framework is composed of a directed network model and a resilience analysis approach. In the network model, different types of interdependencies are integrated through a multilayer network structure. For each layer, the use of directed network and the PageRank algorithm provides an improved representation of node criticality. In resilience analysis, urban disturbances are first classified into two categories based on their paths of propagation. Within each category, disturbance responses of the network can be observed by simulating targeted attacks. This conceptual framework provides a quantitative approach of modeling and analyzing CI interdependencies, which can lead to better understanding of the mechanism of CI interdependencies and provide measures to protect CI against possible cascading failures.},

  abstract = {The importance of end-user participation in the design process of building and construction projects has been recognized and addressed by a number of researchers and practitioners. The main goal is to ensure that the project outcome meets the facility users’ needs. In order to understand their needs, a variety of approaches (e.g. focus groups, workshops, and questionnaires) for the building end-users participation in the design process have been presented in the literature. Despite the contributions and practical features of these methods, they require a significant amount of time and effort to conduct and interpret the participants’ responses. To overcome this limitation, this paper investigates the use of eye-tracking technology to measure and analyze end-user satisfaction. This study is carried out to test the hypothesis that the users’ satisfaction of design variations is related to their visual attention. In other words, design alternatives with high level of users’ satisfaction attract more attention. An experiment using four alternatives for the design of a façade is performed to test the effectiveness of eye-tracking technology. The design alternatives are developed and displayed in a virtual 3D environment. Participants are asked to rate their level of satisfaction with each alternative, while their interaction with the virtual models is recorded using eye-tracking. The results of the experiment are also demonstrated to domain experts to get a better understanding of the technology’s potential and challenges.},

  abstract = {Although bonds have been commonly used for financing construction works in developed countries such as the United States, Asian governments would like to see their construction growth increasingly funded by alternative sources such as the capital market, instead of overrelying on bank loans. Yet even in relatively active markets such as Hong Kong and Singapore, the use of bond financing for infrastructure development is limited. In a recent study based on two questionnaire surveys with subsequent interviews about retail and institutional investors, results demonstrated that credit risk was a major concern and that deterrents include lack of bond market information, illiquidity of domestic bonds, and the reliability of external credit ratings. Institutional investors, however, welcome infrastructure bonds because of the stable income stream matching their long-term commitments. To address these practical concerns, we have proposed credit and liquidity enhancement measures in this paper as the critical success factors for international construction promoters to tap into the bond market for financing construction works in Asia. Hence, this paper will be of interest to academics and practitioners who are working on project financing, because empirical findings reveal investors’ concerns, which are then addressed with recommendations.},

  abstract = {仿真技术已成为研究复杂系统的重要手段,而随着复杂性科学研究的快速发展,复杂系统仿真规模越来越大,个体模型复杂度越来越高,使得大规模复杂系统仿真对计算资源的需求不断增加,如何缩短大规模复杂系统仿真的运行时间,满足复杂系统研究对时效性的需求,是一个亟待研究的问题。近年来,将时间离散的复杂系统模型映射到并行离散事件仿真中的逻辑进程范型上,利用并行离散事件仿真技术提高复杂系统仿真的运行效率已成为解决上述问题的一个重要研究方向。然而,由于复杂系统仿真应用具有交互结构复杂、动态性、个体多样性等特点,使得目前的并行离散事件仿真技术难以充分挖掘复杂系统仿真应用的并行性,从而导致其运行性能不理想。因此,开展面向复杂系统应用的并行离散事件仿真性能优化技术研究,对于提高复杂系统仿真运行效率,提升复杂系统研究能力,适应国民经济和国防建设不断发展的应用需求具有重要的理论意义和实用价值。 	论文针对复杂系统仿真应用的相关特性,以进一步提高复杂系统仿真应用运行效率为根本目标,围绕负载划分、仿真时间同步、兴趣管理等影响并行离散事件仿真性能的关键问题展开研究,论文的主要创新点如下: 	(1)提出了一种面向具有无标度特性交互结构的非均匀静态负载划分算法。由于背景负载等因素的影响,静态负载划分往往需要根据实际可用计算资源非均匀分配仿真任务,而现有主流的面向无标度交互结构的基于赋权图多层k划分的静态负载划分算法主要基于递归二分的划分思想,难以适应计算负载非均匀划分的需求。针对上述问题,论文提出了一个基于集散节点聚合的负载划分算法HAPart,该算法将静态负载划分优化问题转换为一个二部图最小代价赋值问题,从而能够根据实际可用计算资源情况对仿真任务进行非均匀划分;理论证明该算法在解决赋权图非均匀k划分这一NP难问题时,获得了小于3的近似率,且时间复杂度不超过O((k!+1)?kn)(n为顶点个数,k为划分数),实验结果表明HAPart算法相比现有算法平均提高约19\%的仿真运行性能。 	(2)提出了一种乐观时间同步机制下负载划分动态优化算法。现有乐观时间同步机制下负载划分动态优化研究往往分别考虑计算负载平衡和通信优化,难以取得理想的整体优化效果。针对上述问题,论文基于赋权图k划分的动态负载划分模型,提出了一种基于启发式局部搜索策略的增量式迁移算法ALSPart,该算法首先根据计算负载和可用计算资源的变化情况对当前的负载划分进行调整,在此基础上通过顶点集合交换的图划分算法对通信负载进行优化,从而在综合考虑计算负载平衡和通信开销优化的前提下,尽量减少迁移开销;实验结果表明该动态负载划分算法相比现有相关算法平均减少约38\%的回滚开销,从而可有效提高仿真系统总体性能。 	(3)提出了一种基于社区发现的混合时间同步算法。复杂系统仿真中个体的多样性导致单纯使用乐观或是保守时间同步机制都难以得到较好的运行性能。针对该问题,论文结合混合时间同步协议框架,提出了一种基于社区发现的混合时间同步算法HCDSyn,该算法首先通过随机游走过程发掘逻辑进程交互网络中的社区结构,然后根据逻辑进程在社区中的位置为其自动选择恰当的同步机制,从而能在充分发掘系统并行性的同时有效减少系统中级联回滚的发生;实验结果表明该混合时间同步算法相对单纯的保守或乐观时间同步算法平均提升约10\%的整体性能。 	(4)提出了一种多维空间中基于历史信息的动态区域匹配算法。在个体兴趣域动态改变的情况下,直接匹配算法和基于分类的匹配算法匹配速度较慢,而基于网格划分的匹配算法无法兼顾匹配速度和匹配精度。针对该问题,论文提出了一种多维空间中基于历史信息的动态区域匹配算法HIMat,利用位向量表快速确定各维度上相对位置变化的范围以减少需要进行匹配的候选区域,进而通过与存储相交历史信息的二进制位矩阵进行位操作得到变化后各区域的匹配关系,从而提高匹配效率;该算法匹配计算量小于等于O ( d*k)(d为空间维度,k为变化区域所经过的平均区域界点个数),实验结果表明在通常只有部分兴趣区域发生变化的条件下,HIMat算法明显优于直接区域匹配算法和基于分类的区域匹配算法,而与采用稀疏网格的网格法性能接近,但采用稀疏网格的网格法过滤效果差,存在虚假连接,HIMat算法则实现了精确匹配。 	在上述研究成果的基础上,论文结合课题组研制的YH-SUPE并行离散事件仿真引擎设计实现了一个面向复杂系统应用的开放式并行离散事件仿真框架;并通过突发公共事件条件下的民意趋势模型对其进行了综合测试,结果表明论文所提出的优化技术可使得整体仿真系统平均获得约35\%的性能提高。},

  title = {{车辆合乘匹配问题研究}},
  abstract = {进入21世纪以来我国经济飞速发展,随着人民生活水平的不断提高,私家车拥有量不断攀升。私家车大规模进入寻常家庭给人们带来了许多便利和享受,在扩大内需、促进经济发展、提高人民生活水平等方面都起着重要作用。然而,私家车的快速发展一定程度上造成环境污染、交通拥堵、资源利用率低等一系列的社会问题,阻碍着城市交通的健康发展,如何合理的利用好私家车这个社会资源,提高社会资源的利用率,降低环境污染,使私家车出行惠及全社会,成为了一个大家不得不思考和解决的重要问题,由此各国学者提出了车辆合乘匹配(Vehicle Ride-Matching,RMP)——即“拼车”的解决方案。 	车辆合乘匹配问题,是指车主与搭乘顺风车的乘客双方达成一定的约定,车主愿意让乘客顺便搭乘自己驾驶的车辆出行,并在双方认为合适的地方让乘客下车,合乘产生的费用由乘客(包括车主)分摊的出行方式。目前,针对车辆合乘匹配问题,国内外已经有了一些研究成果,为后续的深入研究奠定了重要的基础。但是现有的研究仍存在以下几点不足: 	(1)当前的车辆合乘匹配问题着重于合乘匹配制度、政策、道路设施等方面的研究,对于合乘匹配问题具体数据模型的构建以及调度优化等方面的研究较少。 	(2)现有的车辆合乘网站,大多只是简单的信息发布供求平台,不具备智能匹配功能,没有较好的乘客选择方法,无法保证合乘行驶路线的最优化。 	(3)车辆合乘涉及到车主和乘客双方,由于受路线匹配程度、花费成本、时间窗、车主和乘客的容忍度等因素的影响,导致搭载成功率比较低。 	本文在已有的研究成果基础上,针对以上问题展开研究,主要的研究工作概括如下: 	1.对现有的车辆合乘匹配问题相关研究进行了系统的总结和分析,综述了车辆合乘匹配问题。 	在定义了车辆合乘匹配问题概念、研究要素和分类的基础上,给出了车辆合乘匹配问题的研究现状,分析了车辆合乘匹配研究存在的问题。详细地综述了求解车辆合乘匹配问题的启发式算法,系统地描述了各种算法的机理。 	2.针对单车辆合乘匹配问题,构建了带约束条件的数学模型,并提出了基于乘客选择的合乘路线优化方法,有效地解决了乘客选择盲目性问题,提高了合乘路线匹配的效率。 	通过引入容量约束和时间窗约束,研究了带约束条件的单车辆合乘匹配问题,构建了合乘匹配问题的数学模型,并提出了求解该模型的算法。单车辆合乘匹配问题的解决方案往往过于重视乘客选择,忽视车主的意愿,而使合乘路线与车主原本的行驶路线出现很大的偏离,本文提出在车主最优行驶路线的基础上进行乘客选择,既重视了车主的意愿,又满足了乘客的要求。本文提出的解决方法分为三部分:第一部分,利用Dijkstra算法找出车主的最优行驶路线;第二部分,在车主最优行驶路线的基础上,优先选择与车主路线基本匹配的乘客,其次选择不完全匹配的乘客;第三部分,利用优先关系确定乘客的搭乘顺序,并重新优化合乘的行驶路线。实验结果说明,该算法有效地解决了乘客选择盲目性的问题,提高了合乘路线匹配的效率。 	3.针对多车辆合乘匹配问题,构建了数学模型,提出了一种两阶段算法,有效地提高了多车辆合乘的搭载成功率,实现了合乘路线最优的目标。 	通过对单车辆合乘匹配问题的扩展,引入新的约束条件,研究了一类多车辆合乘匹配问题。考虑到在搭载成功率高的情况下,实现合乘路径最短的目标,构建了问题的数学模型。在该模型中采用软时间窗约束,加入了一定的惩罚机制,使模型更接近现实。本文提出了求解该模型的两阶段算法。第一阶段,采用乘客分配算法去解决乘客分类问题,通过乘客的单乘距离与重叠距离的关系,实现乘客最终分类;第二阶段,利用改进的遗传算法解决各合乘车辆行驶路线问题。实验结果说明,建立的模型能够很好的模拟多车辆合乘匹配问题,提出的算法能有效的解决该模型。},

  abstract = {随着互联网的迅猛发展,网络的用户规模及业务规模不断扩大,传统的IP互联网体系已经难以适应全球网络规模的扩张速度。网络虚拟化作为推动当前互联网发展和创新的重要手段应运而生,它支持多个虚拟网络彼此隔离地共享物理网络资源,能够经济快速地创建虚拟网络,并在虚拟网络上按照用户的需求部署网络业务。高效可靠的资源分配机制是网络虚拟化技术得以推广应用的关键。与传统网络相比,网络虚拟化环境下的网络运营和创建更加灵活多样,在可管理性、成本效益、实时性及安全性等方面有较高的要求。相应地,网络虚拟化环境下的资源分配机制也面临新的挑战:第一资源分配由多个阶段共同完成,因此,既要为各阶段提供解决方法,又要考虑各阶段问的承接关系以形成完整的资源分配机制;第二,资源分配要兼顾经济高效和安全可靠,因此,要从整体角度出发,对资源分配各阶段的高效性和可靠性加以权衡。为了解决以上问题,本文面向资源分配不同阶段(虚拟资源匹配、虚拟网络划分、虚拟网络映射及重映射)的具体需求,对网络虚拟化环境下高效可靠的资源分配机制进行了研究,主要贡献如下:(1)提出一种基于知识描述的虚拟资源匹配方法。针对虚拟资源匹配过程的实用性和精确性问题,新方法先用网络本体语言构建了虚拟资源描述知识库,并用规则查询语言对虚拟网络映射约束的描述方式加以规范;再借助规则查询工具设计了虚拟资源匹配算法。案例分析表明,新方法在保证一定匹配效率的前提下,能支持用户表达多样化的映射约束以及精确的数值属性匹配,为后续虚拟网络划分阶段提供了可靠的依据。(2)提出一种基于遗传算法的虚拟网络划分算法。针对跨域映射中虚拟网络的划分效率与划分方案优化程度间的平衡问题,新算法将划分方案以矩阵形式编码,从多个随机的初始方案开始进行迭代搜索,逐步逼近全局最优解。理论分析证明,新算法可以终止,且搜索空间包含整个解空间。仿真结果表明,新算法提高了虚拟网络划分的求解效率,且其划分方案与最优划分方案的偏差可控制在5\%以内。(3)提出一种轻量级的生存性虚拟网络映射方法。针对生存性虚拟网络映射中备份资源分配不合理的问题,新方法根据物理网络的拓扑属性定义物理节点的可恢复度,并在虚拟网络的初始映射中将重要虚拟节点优先映射到可恢复度高的物理节点上。实验表明,新方法有效提高了备份资源的利用率,在不影响映射效率的前提下提高了虚拟网络在受到多节点故障影响时的生存性。(4)提出一种面向多节点故障的虚拟网络重映射方法。针对发生多节点故障时的虚拟网络恢复问题,新方法考虑了物理网络的拓扑和能力属性对重映射的影响,利用混合整数规划,分别以降低失效赔偿、优化可用备份资源的连通性、均衡备份资源负载为目标,提出了三种重映射策略。实验表明,在多节点故障模型下,三种重映射策略分别适用于提高不同物理网络中的重映射成功率,提高基础设施提供商的长期运营利润。},

  abstract = {随着计算机网络技术的飞速发展,制造业的全球化、信息化日益突显,制造资源的共享度和利用率不断提高,网络化制造、制造网格等利用计算机网络技术的新型制造模式逐渐成为现代制造业的主要模式。近年来,随着云计算等“云理论”的发展,云制造的概念开始兴起。云制造是云计算在制造业的落地和延伸,它体现了“分散资源集中使用”和“集中资源分散服务”的思想,以“多对多”的服务模式,汇聚分布式资源进行集中管理,实现制造资源的高度共享和高效利用,提高制造企业的生产效益,为用户提供更高满意度和更环保的产品及服务。 	云制造是一种大规模网络化分布式制造,与网络化制造、制造网格等一脉相承,并具有三方面特征:云制造资源海量性、异构性、复杂性和粗粒度性;云制造的用户具有高度的参与性和多样性;云制造具有较强的自修复性。依据这三个特征,本文在国家自然科学基金(60970021)和浙江省科技计划项目(2007C21013)的支持下,着重研究了云制造环境下制造资源的定义、发布、匹配和选择问题,包括以下几方面: 	(1)针对云资源海量、复杂、异构的特征,提出了云制造体系结构、双层资源模型,以及基于资源云服务(RVCS:Resources Via Cloud Service)的资源封装、发布和发现机制。以WSRF体系架构为基础,提出了云制造体系结构,并详细分析了其中云端系统和云制造平台系统的逻辑层次和逻辑关系。在此基础上,根据云端和云制造平台不同的功能需求,提出了云端-云制造平台相分离的双层资源模型(BCMRM:Bilayer Cloud Manufacturing Resource Model):在云端建立面向资源基本属性的基础数据模型,在云制造平台建立面向资源服务属性的功能数据模型,并存在逻辑映射关系,实现了复杂、异构资源的统一数据模型。并且,根据云资源动态属性的功能特征和更新频率分为三层次两类别,即资源属性、服务属性和提供者属性三个层次,以及特征属性和状态属性两个类别。根据动态属性划分,引入具有实时侦听和属性甄别功能的连接器和云代理,进一步提出了基于RVCS的云资源封装、发布和发现机制,以便实现海量云资源数据的分布式存储和快速独立更新。通过对比实验,证明在大规模数据环境下,能够较好地提高资源发布和更新效率。 	(2)针对云资源粗粒度性的特征,提出了一种基于多维可拓理论的云资源性能相似度计算方法。首先提出特征属性匹配的核心是云服务资源性能属性的匹配。通过物元模型描述云资源的性能属性和用户需求,并根据性能指标数分为一维、二维、三维和多维等四类性能模块,从而将云资源性能匹配问题转化为多维空间中点与多维体的可拓距计算问题,并进一步建立关联函数计算云资源性能模块的匹配度。同时,提出了自定义权重、结构权重和实例权重相结合权重确定方法,从而获得云服务资源性能属性综合相似度。通过实验,验证了该方法具有较好的最佳资源命中性,且降低了粗粒度云资源指标权重计算的复杂度。 	(3)针对云制造用户高度参与性和多样性的特征,以Beth信任关系理论为基础,提出了一种基于用户自主预测评估和其他用户推荐评估的云资源QoS评估方法。首先提出了状态属性匹配的核心是云服务资源的QoS评估,并建立了一种基于预测评估和推荐评估的云资源QoS评估方法:对于预测评估,引入时效性经验因子和经验修正因子,优化了基于用户历史评价的预测模型;对于推荐评估,建立了基于历史经历的推荐用户粗选方法,和基于评价相似度与客观度的推荐用户群精选方法。最后通过变异系数,获得更为全面的QOS评估。通过对比实验,证明了预测评估能够充分反应历史评价且具有较好的灵敏性,满足了高度的用户参与性;用户筛选算法能够很好地过滤恶意评价和劣质评价,避免了用户多样性带来的干扰。 	(4)针对云制造节点突发故障时替代资源选取问题,建立了基于三角模糊数互补判断矩阵的制造风险可拓评价模型,并进一步提出了云资源动态调整策略。替代资源的选取从制造风险和动态属性匹配度两个方面进行考量:首先在可拓物元模型的基础上建立云资源制造风险评价模型,通过三角模糊数互补判断矩阵计算获得风险指标权重,并给出了三种生产关系的组合风险计算方法;在动态属性匹配度计算中,采用变异系数和使用门限相结合的方法,解决了性能匹配度与QoS评估值的不可比问题和QOS评估的客观性问题。通过实验,验证了该方法能够较为全面地反映资源的制造风险和可替代性。},

  abstract = {The assignment problem is one of the fundamental combinatorial optimization problems in the branch of optimization or operations research in mathematics. It consists of finding a maximum weight matching (or minimum weight perfect matching) in a weighted bipartite graph.
In its most general form, the problem is as follows:
The problem instance has a number of agents and a number of tasks. Any agent can be assigned to perform any task, incurring some cost that may vary depending on the agent-task assignment. It is required to perform all tasks by assigning exactly one agent to each task and exactly one task to each agent in such a way that the total cost of the assignment is minimized.
If the numbers of agents and tasks are equal and the total cost of the assignment for all tasks is equal to the sum of the costs for each agent (or the sum of the costs for each task, which is the same thing in this case), then the problem is called the linear assignment problem. Commonly, when speaking of the assignment problem without any additional qualification, then the linear assignment problem is meant.},

  abstract = {Let K1,n denote the star on n + 1 vertices; that is, K1,n is the complete bipartite graph having one vertex in the first vertex class of its bipartition and n in the second. The special graph K1,3, called the claw, has received much attention in the literature. In particular, a graph G is said to be claw-free if G possesses no K1,3 as an induced subgraph. A well-known theorem of Sumner and, independently, Las Vergnas says that every connected even claw-free graph contains a perfect matching. (Later, Jünger, Pulleyblank, and Reinelt proved that if G is connected, claw-free, and odd, then G must contain a near-perfect matching.) More generally, Sumner proved that if G is K1,n-free, (n − 1)-connected, and even, then G must contain a perfect matching. In this paper, we extend these results in several ways. First, we show that if G is a k-connected K1,n-free graph on p vertices, then def(G) is bounded above by a certain function of k,n, and p, where def(G) is the deficiency of G. (The deficiency of a graph measures how far a maximum matching is from being perfect; that is, def (G) = p − 2ν(G), where ν(G) is the size of any maximum matching in G.) We then provide examples to show that this upper bound is sharp for each value of k and n. We then prove a result that is a type of converse to the above theorem in the following sense. Suppose that H is a connected graph and suppose that there exist constants α and β, 0 ≤ α $<$ 1, such that every k-connected H-free graph G of sufficiently large order satisfies (G) ≤ α|V(G)| + β. Then the excluded subgraph H must be a K1,n, where n is bounded above by a certain function of α and k. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Graph Theory},

  title = {{工程进度冲突协调机制研究}},
  abstract = {工程进度是项目参与各方控制和决策的重点,工程建设过程中,纵向有契约关系的主体间以及横向无契约关系的平行主体间的进度冲突现象频发。造成各方进度冲突的原因除进度计划本身的复杂性外,很重要的一点是各方在进度控制上的利益冲突。各方都站在自身立场以利益最大化为目标进行决策,忽略了决策的相互影响,缺乏均衡优化的思想。而集中决策模式下的进度冲突协调,需要决策者收集所有相关信息,进行集中运算,求解工作量大,决策变量的个数在建模之后也就固定了,不适合工程环境的动态性;而且,由于忽略各方的自治性(信息私有性、利益独立性、决策自主性),很难在工程进度冲突协调这样的信息不完全和多主体分散决策的实际环境下得到应用。为此,本文从利益协调入手,运用博弈均衡等理论,针对总承包工程,构建进度冲突协调的量化模型,指导进度冲突各方的利益协调。同时,工程环境的动态性、信息不完全和多主体分散决策特点使得协商成为自然而重要的利益协调途径,为此,本文后半部分以前述的量化模型为基础,基于MAS协商协调理论,对进度冲突的MAS协商协调做了较为深入的探讨。从而形成了本文如下研究内容:
首先,明确了合作型项目组织中进度冲突协调的层次性,其中协商协调层和利益协调层是关键。考虑参与各方的自治性,将均衡优化作为协调的基本思路。指出纵向主体间进度冲突协调具有主从对策特点和决策的层次性,横向主体间进度冲突协调具有平等协商性。鉴于横向主体间进度冲突的主控协调模式的不足,引入自主协调模式作为有益补充,给出了进度冲突协调合作形成的三种机制及其互动关系。
在纵向,业主、总承包商和专业承包商是主从关系,可以在完善激励措施的基础上,实现双方进度目标的协调优化。这就涉及到上层如何选择激励对象并有效地分配激励和下层在何种情况,以多大的努力加速进度等问题。为此,建立以总承包商为主方、多专业承包商为从方的进度协调主从对策模型,利用逆向归纳法对模型进行求解,给出模型均衡解的形式化数学表达,对可能出现的各种情况进行了系统分析,并结合具体实例解释模型参数对各方均衡解的影响,得出各方协调优化原则,用于指导主从各方在进度协调中的决策。研究表明模型可以实现进度目标的协调优化和各方收益的帕累托改善。
在横向,专业承包商间是不存在契约关系的平行主体,出现进度冲突时需要各方的自主协调。以何种形式实现冲突的协调、各方如何决策、协调收益如何分配等是需要考虑的问题。引入多主体TCTP(MaTCTP)来描述平行主体间进度冲突的自主协调。考虑任务所属主体的自治性,MaTCTP是理性个体协作问题。借鉴资源交换协调的思路,将MaTCTP求解看作不同利益主体的任务间关于时间资源的交换协调,建立利益补偿机制解决MaTCTP中主体间的利益转移问题。在补偿机制的基础上建立基于MaTCTP的进度协调合作博弈模型,利用Shapley值法分配协调收益,并分析各方协调过程的决策行为。最后以实例阐述了MaTCTP建模和合作博弈模型的应用过程。
上述主从对策模型和合作博弈模型都不涉及理性个体达成合作的过程,需要构造适当的协商模型加以表现。同时,工程环境的动态性,使得达成的上述协调协议具有“契约不完全性”,基于协商的进度冲突协调更符合工程实际环境。为此,在个体理性,信息交换,MAS协商的基础上,建立进度冲突的MAS协商协调模型。
首先,利用Multi-Agent表达工程任务网络,建立进度冲突协商协调的MAS虚拟联盟,联盟中Agent扮演主控Agent(MAgent)和任务Agent(RAgent)两种角色,RAgent间是平行关系,MAgent与RAgent间是主从关系,彼此通过协商来协调进度冲突中的利益矛盾。给出RAgent间协商协调的整体目标,对RAgent间的交互进行建模,设计RAgent的效用计算模型和交互推理过程,使得RAgent在追求个体理性的同时实现整体目标。构建两阶段承诺协商协议支持RAgent间的信息交换以达成“互利”合作,并给出RAgent间协商协调的步骤,再以动态再调度为例阐述其应用。采用合同网刻画MAgent与RAgent间进度冲突的协商协调,MAgent与RAgent通过招投标建立初步的协调意向,然后就工期压缩和奖励金额等进行自动协商。给出了自动协商的偏好模型、效用函数和协商策略,并以第3章中实例的数据进行协商过程的仿真,结果表明能够达到彼此协调的目的。进度冲突的MAS协商协调与传统的集中决策模式下的冲突协调相比,更符合工程实际,易于理解和应用,而且Agent的构造灵活,模型具有更大的柔性。},
